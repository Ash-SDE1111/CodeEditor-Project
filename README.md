# CodeEditor-Project
I have made the code editor project where one can write code in Html and give it design using Css and functionality using JavaScript.
After writing/applying code, it will show the output.
I have made 4 buttons named Copy, Save, Lock and Unlock.
When one click on Copy button it will copy the output value and show the copied output value in alert.
When one click on Save button , the output will be downloaded and saved in txt format and Pop up the message that it is saved.
When one click on Lock button, it will lock the interface and user cannot write, modify or update anything. It will show the alert- "Disabled All Text areas".
When one click on Unlock button, it will unlocked the interface and user can write, modify or update anything. It will show the alert-"Enabled All Text Areas".
